**Project: FNP Sales Analysis Dashboard**

**Problem Statement**

Ferns N Petals (FNP), a leading gifting and flower delivery company, aims to better understand its sales performance across various dimensions such as customer behavior, product preferences, time-based trends, and geographic reach. Despite having a large volume of transactional data, the business lacks clear insights into key performance drivers and customer purchasing patterns.

The primary objective of this project is to analyze and visualize sales data to answer critical business questions:

1) What is the overall revenue performance and order volume?

2) Which occasions and product categories contribute the most to revenue?

3) What are the average order value and delivery timelines?

4) Which cities have the highest order concentration?

5) What are the top-selling products?

6) How does revenue vary by time of day and by month?

To address these questions, the raw sales data was cleaned and transformed using Power Query Editor in Excel. A data model was developed to connect multiple tables and support dynamic slicing and aggregation. Key metrics and visualizations were created within Excel to deliver an interactive dashboard that enables stakeholders to:

1. Identify top-performing products, cities, and time slots.

2. Evaluate seasonal and occasion-based sales trends.

3. Optimize inventory and marketing strategies based on customer behavior insights.

4. This project provides a foundational step toward data-driven decision-making within FNP's sales and marketing operations.
